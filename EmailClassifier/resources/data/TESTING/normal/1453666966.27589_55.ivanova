The food quality is better than other Ruby Tuesdays, but the customer service... Been awhile since I have been to a Waffle House and it did not let me down. Thanks for the great service. If we are ever back in the area you better believe... Monday night pizza special is one heck of a great deal!!!!  And the mushroom Swiss burger was fabulous!!!!!   So moist and delicious!  And of course there... What a great find! Saw it on yelp while just passing through, the parking in the square was a little tricky to figure out but once inside was well worth it.... I have got two words for you: Chicken Scaloppini with Mushrooms and Prosciutto Sherry Cream Sauce! Oh god! Makes my watery mouth again....whoops I said that... We went to Rhapsody Global Tapas Sunday evening after the Colts game.  To say the restaurant was dead would be an understatement.  We were the only ones... Enjoyed the best lightly breaded jumbo tenderloin ever today. Took my dad out for lunch any thoroughly enjoyed the service and the food. Locally owned and... Fabulous food!..
