Good food, service and ambiance...A great place to socialize.with friends...A wonderful asset to our community. The food was delicious!  The Manhattan beef with melt in your mouth pot roast and mashed potatoes was fantastic.  The liver and onions which our waitress... Great fried chicken on the buffet. Love the atmosphere. If you're traveling I90 through Ohio, this is a worthwhile stop at any time of day!  Really enjoyed the fluffy Greek omelette, and the Reuben sandwich... Decent food and great service. I stopped by when I was driving through Ohio. I was surprised that the restaurant was full. I used to go to the one across... This is the one place I always have to stop at while I'm down this way. They have the absolute best grinders you'll ever have. It's a cute little diner... Great pizza and much more! The Wyse family will serve you well here. f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
