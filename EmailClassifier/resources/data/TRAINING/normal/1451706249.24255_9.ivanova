I've taken my family here as part of our vacation for over a decade, and every visit has been a wonderful experience -- the food is top-notch, the staff... One of the few remaining lakeside restaurants in the Hayward area, The Waterfront is consistently the best whether it's Friday Night Fish Fry or dinner off... A friend recommended the wood-fired Pizza.  My family loved it.  The farm is family owned.  We took a farm tour and were fascinated by the food and animals....
