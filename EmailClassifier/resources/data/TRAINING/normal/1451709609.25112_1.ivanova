Wanted: American boyfriends for beautiful Asian singles, exclusively here> http://gohere.jozsw.faith/connect

Don't no how anyone could give this place less then 5 stars were rating the food and service here not the tiny salad bar when Jeff is cooking u couldn't... Being from Chicago, I have rather high standards for pizza. I went in here with absolutely no expectations. I was going to take things for what they were... Prime rib au jus was amazing.  And the wing sauce choices cannot be beat!  Never had a bad item off the menu!   Good amount of food for your $$! I wasn't expecting this place in such a small town. A pleasant find. Popped in for lunch. The menu isn't extensive, but has some decent, light lunch... For 10 days every October this is basically my second home when I'm in Ransom County bird hunting.  Rural North Dakota is f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
