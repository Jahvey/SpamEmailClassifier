Excellent buffet, one of the best I have ever eaten at and I have been to many buffets, much, much better than Golden Coral. ..The only complaint that I have... Let's face it, there's no real authentic sushi places in America; certainly this is the case in Fayetteville, NC. Logistically, it would be near impossible... I am always impressed with the shrimp at Bruce and Mickey's. I travel extensively and can never find the equal to Bruce's shrimp and slaw. This eatery...
