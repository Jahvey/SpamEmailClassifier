Greetings bruce@untroubled.org,

An retired CIA agent just revealed the ONLY self-defense tool he carries to protect himself at all times.

It fits in your pocket and is as deadly as a gun... and you are able to take it on a plane. It is completely legal!

It's only one of over 101 spy secrets that he is revealing to the public today in one FREE book.

Unfortunately, he only has 250 to give out today. But you are still able to claim yours today!

Go here now to claim your free copy and keep yourself protected at all times: http://knowmore.zgbsdmovement.eu/preview


To your safety,

Roderick Cobb

Director, Laissez Faire Club

We had BLT and a French Dip.  Both were very good and had generous portions.  The pasta salad was a great choice for side.... Decent food. Decent service. Good price.
