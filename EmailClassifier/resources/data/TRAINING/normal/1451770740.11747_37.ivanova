Wanted: Boyfriends for hot Asian girls, exclusively here> http://search.mnjxcover.eu/signupnow

Did not have an opportunity to have the food but I wanted to write a quick note about the service. While on a last minute shopping run a couple of us... Like the Root Beer Stands of old.  Call your order in and pick it up fresh and hot.  Everything from shakes to salads, from fried chicken to chili dogs! I for sure am not a fan of BBQ, but I have to say it was some of the best I have tried. ..The meat (chicken and beef) was cooked just right with the ideal... Had the lunch special here today (Ruben sandwich and salad bar). This place seems very clean and generic. The Ruben was ok and the salad bar was fair.... The best enchiladas and supreme burrito I've ever had. Definitely worth getting off I-80 for. We were passing through on a summer Tuesday and decided to stay in this town. There are a lot of eateries but this one just looked interesting so we ended... My favorite thing f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
