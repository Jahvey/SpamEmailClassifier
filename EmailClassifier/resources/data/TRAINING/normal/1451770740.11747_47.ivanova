Great Sunday Lunch!....I really enjoyed the seasonal Butternut Squash Ravioli with candied walnuts and sage. My husband got The Stack and it was wonderfully... The food here is great!  We've eaten there a lot and are working our way thru the appetizer menu along with everything else and no disappointments at all!... Carla (Friday nights only) is a great Waitress - we always ask for her.  The fried mushrooms are to die for and the chicken quesadilla is on the top of my... I'm a local and I make sure I take all my guests in town to here!  Great food and service.  They have homemade onion rings that are some of the best I have... Best place to eat in Festus!  This is the only place all 5 of our family enthusiastically piles into the car for.  The ONLY place.  I have eaten Thai food... I ate here with a few friends for Mother's Day and I really have to say, even though they were pretty busy everyone there was on top of \"if8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047

I ate here with a few friends for Mother's Day and I really have to say, even though they were pretty busy everyone there was on top of \"it\". Drinks,... Really unexpectedly fantastic!..I didn't know it was a buffet and was very surprised at how good it was.  The fried chicken was delish and there were plenty... Wow, this place was far beyond expectation. I guess we should have known when it was mostly full even before noon.....I'm a bit of a chicken wing snob,... Love this place.  The food is so good.  I always get the enchiladas and my guy always gets the soft tacos.  Very good service. 2015 YELP 100 CHALLENGE - 086/100....My Yelp buddie Tiffany L. introduced me to R+D Kitchen a few weeks ago, and I am a fan!....I've had this place bookmarked... Estate was an absolute pleasure to dine at from beginning to end. First, I love the space and design aesthetic. It was romantic and they had great music... This was a bucket list burger, having heard so much chatter about it being one of the best burger joints around...The restaurant is cool, though it's not... Great food, decent prices, good service, perfect ambiance- just visit this place. Pro Tip- Fries can be split by 4 people, do NOT forgo the Blue Cheese... Went in today for a late lunch.  Had just a great experience despite some real dietary issues with one person in the group.....Our waiter was Everett and he... I'm absolutely obsessed with this place. Why? ....1. It's in a great location..2. The wine and cheese selection is extensive and all on point..3. Amazing... What a great spot! For a while I thought it was actually a breakfast diner but of course I was wrong. Ingo's has a great menu with reasonable prices... When a restaurant does a small menu right, it's a thing of beauty. It feels as though you've been invited to an exclusive dinner with a menu specially... So. Much. Yes. I don't know why it took me so long to eat here, but it was worth the wait! A girlfriend and I dropped in for a relatively early weekday...f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
