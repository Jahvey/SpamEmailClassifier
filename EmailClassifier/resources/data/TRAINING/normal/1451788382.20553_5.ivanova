This is exactly what you want in a small-town restaurant.  It's not only a solid spot for food in Dorset, it's a great meal and friendly service no matter...

But the taco pizza is amazing.  Totally worth the wait. This is my favorite restaurant. Nick is the master chief and he has great helpers. It's a fixed price menu and expensive but worth it.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
