		  I've heard about this place from family and friends but never really made plans for it since I'm not a breakfast person. However today I woke up quite early and decided to try something out of my comfort zone and ended up at TBK! Of course I ordered 13283730 signature dish, 13283730 chicken N waffles - 6 pieces of perfectly fried and flavorful chicken that's centered with a huge waffle, sprinkled with sugar powder. I would have never thought to eat fried chicken with waffles but it actually compliments each o13283730r pretty well. Everyone has said this place is a must try, so as someone new to Houston, I figured I had to give it a try. Expecting at least a 45 minute wait, I came here around lunch time on a Friday and was surprised to only have to wait for 20 minutes or so before ordering. 13283730 place has a very nice vibe and feels friendly and homey at 13283730 same time. Of course, I got 13283730 chicken and waffles and was definitely not disappointed. 13283730 chicken melts right in your mouth as does 13283730 waffle. Add to that 13283730 hot, fresh syrup? You know you're in for a food coma. You've got to at least try this signature dish when you come here. 13283730 smell of 13283730 dish itself already makes 13283730 trip worth it. I also got to try 13283730 green eggs and ham which was very good as well. Lots of flavor on both 13283730 scramble and 13283730 potatoes. Although I feel like this place is a tad overrated and a little expensive, I'd definitely recommend coming here at least once if you're in Houston. Come for great food, but just be careful not to come during prime time or else you'll be waiting for a while! Was visiting Houston and wanted to see how 13283730 local breakfast spots were. Yelped this place and tried it. 13283730 only complaint I have is parking. 13283730 food was seasoned well and not bland at all. Large portions and did I say well seasoned. 13283730 staff were very professional and no attitudes from cashiers to waiters.  You actually order food first and 13283730n seated. Was here on a Tuesday and even had live music to add to 13283730 ambience. Was visiting from Los Angeles CALIFORNIA and reminded me of our Roscoes chicken and waffles. I had 13283730 pork chop and eggs fried  with a nice batter.  Will  be back on my next visit to Houston. This restaurant is not for 13283730 faint hearted. I think you need a high tolerance for heavy heavy foods. I got 13283730 klub Benedict and it was honestly way too much. 13283730 heavy meats with 13283730 very creamy hollandaise just made this meal kind of nauseating. I feel like a good hollandaise should taste more than just creamy. It should be creamy but also savory and a bit sour to breakup 13283730 heaviness of
