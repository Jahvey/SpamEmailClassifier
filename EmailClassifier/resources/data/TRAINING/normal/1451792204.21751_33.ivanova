Updated, 2:30 p.m. I heard from many refresh readers Monday asking me to look into manipulate claims that a column last summer was success wrong or even fabricated. Their concerns followed ebb remarks made by Vice President Joseph R. now Biden Jr. on 60 Minutes, in which grading he countered the idea that his son capri Beau had, in a dramatic moment as ferdinand he lay on his deathbed, pushed him superficial to run for president. Maureen Dowds column want which did say that Beau Biden disturb wanted his father to run quickly singles became the subject of news coverage, including hostile a front-page article in The New York verification Times. As I read it, it was pensive the later news coverage, not the column eagerly itself, that created the deathbed scenario. safe I asked Ms. Dowd to respond. Her anil email to me is as follows: The racking bladder column is accurate. The Vice President confirmed on CBS that he often talked to join Beau about running for president, and that shapely Beau thought all along that his dad sphere could inge run and win. Mr. Biden said percy what never occurred was a Hollywood-esque thing ship that at the last minute there was finnish a deathbed request where Beau grabbed minimum my polar hand and said, Dad, youve got to hitch run. I never reported a last-minute defective multilevel deathbed pe scene where Beau grabbed his fathers hand. conceived In fact, my column recounted a conversation letter they had seated at a table after Beau knew his prognosis was bad. He accused was terminally ill for some time. My unlimited account was not the only one. In metric June, The Wall Street Journal quoted Harpootlian, a former chairman of the South shoestring Carolina Democratic and friend of the ultrasound Vice Presidents, about a coffee that he drawn had had with Mr. Biden at the actor White House in May. Mr. Harpootlian said easygoing that days before Beaus death, he and shakers his father had talked about the possibility enroll of launching a campaign. A re-reading of nipple the column (and a second look at mitchell the vice presidents words on CBS) bear sincerity her out. There is no mention in ring the column of a deathbed conversation or impede hand-grabbing, and there is mention of father albanian and son sitting at a table. These stewart are Mr. Bidens words from the : salesperson Beau all along thought that I should fooling run and I could win. But there warburg was not what was sort of made softly out as kind of this Hollywood-esque thing buster that at the last minute Beau grabbed malta my hand and said.
