God Bless You as You Devote Your Time Reading This Mail

May God Bless You as You read. I am Mrs Cynthia  Hopewell,suffering from cancerous ailment.

I was married to Mr.Brian Hopewell ,my husband worked with Chevron/Texaco in the United Kingdom for twenty years before he died in the year 2013 during the Spanish train crash which took him away from me. copy paste the link below for news info on edition.cnn.com/2013/07/30/world/europe/spain-train-crash  My late husband deposited the sum of 2.5 Euros (Two Million Five Hundred Thousand Euros) with a Bank in Spain.

Recently,I am currently in hospital here in Spain for the past two months undergoing treatment and my Doctor told me that I have limited days to live due to the stroke and cancerous problems I am suffering from.I have decided to donate this funds to charity Home through you and want you to use my husbands effort to fund the upkeep of widows and charities worldwide.

I took this decision because I do not have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are bourgeois and very wealthy persons and I do not want my husband hard earned money to be misused so In This Faith i have decided so please be Oblidged to do this for GOD as i Await your urgent reply, so I will give you more information and direction on how to contact the bank where this money is been deposited.

With God all things are possible.

Your Sister in Christ,
Mrs Cynthia Hopewell
