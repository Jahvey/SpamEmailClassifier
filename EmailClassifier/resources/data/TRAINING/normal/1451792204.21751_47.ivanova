Ending Soon: Kohl's Holiday Sale- Beat the crowds and save, here only- http://checkitnow.energysaveup.faith/getitnow

One of my local favorites.  Everything I've had there has been wonderful and you can tell they're making it fresh to order and pack the food full of flavor.... My sister lives nearby. I had a good experience, above average Grill food and service from the staff. Nice new building, lots of wood \u0026 some stone.  ....I am... Another hidden gem in La Junta, serious 5 star breakfast burritos, huge and loaded with fresh ingredients at a very reasonable price.  Might as well get it... LOVE the wait staff.  Krystal and Brooklyn are bright, attentive, and charming.  A delight to find two such friendly ladies in this town where we knew no... I love finding restaurants with character. What a cool church turned restaurant. The food was great! I had a Chef Salad which was very fresh and a cup of... We had the ultimate margarita (amazing- best I've ever had), carne asada burrito and pollo burracho. ..Server was af8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
