Victorians, and Melburnians in particular, are said to be "more progressive than other Australians", and although "most Australians support gay marriage", it is supported "nowhere more strongly than in Victoria." At the republic referendum in 1999, the state with the highest yes vote was Victoria. Victorians are also said to be "generally socially progressive, supportive of multiculturalism, wary of extremes of any kind."[14] Premier Daniel Andrews leads the Australian Labor Party that won the November 2014 Victorian state election. The centre-left Australian Labor Party (ALP), the centre-right Liberal Party of Australia, the rural-based National Party of Australia, and the environmentalist Australian Greens are Victoria's main political parties. Traditionally, Labor is strongest in Melbourne's working class western and northern suburbs, and the regional cities of Ballarat, Bendigo and Geelong. The Liberals' main support lies in Melbourne's more affluent eastern and outer suburbs, and some rural and regional centres. The Nationals are strongest in Victoria's North Western and Eastern rural regional areas. The Greens, who won their first lower house seats in 2014, are strongest in inner Melbourne. Federal government Victoria is incorporated into 79 municipalities for the purposes of local government, including 39 shires, 32 cities, seven rural cities and one borough. Shire and city councils are responsible for functions delegated by the Victorian parliament, such as city planning, road infrastructure and waste management. Council revenue comes mostly from property taxes and government grants.[15] Melbourne, the state capital, is home to more than three in four Victorians. The 2011 Australian census reported that Victoria had 5,354,042 people resident at the time of the census.[16] The Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates that the population may well reach 7.2 million by 2050. Victoria's founding Anglo-Celtic population has been supplemented by successive waves of migrants from southern and eastern Europe, Southeast Asia and, most recently, the Horn of Africa and the Middle East. Victoria's population is ageing in proportion with the average of the remainder of the Australian population. About 72% of Victorians are Australian-born. This figure falls to around 66% in Melbourne but rises to higher than 95% in some rural areas in the north west of the state. Around two-thirds of Victorians claim Australian, Scottish, English or Irish ancestry. Less than 1% of Victorians identify themselves as Aboriginal. The largest groups of people born outside Australia came from the British Isles, China, Italy, Vietnam, Greece and New Zealand. More than 75% of Victorians live in Melbourne, located in the state's south. The greater Melbourne metropolitan area is home to an estimated 4.17 million people.[17] Leading urban centres outside Melbourne include Geelong, Ballarat, Bendigo, Shepparton, Mildura, Warrnambool, W

Victorians, and Melburnians in particular, are said to be "more progressive=
 than other Australians", and although "most Australians support gay marria=
ge", it is supported "nowhere more strongly than in Victoria." At the repub=
lic referendum in 1999, the state with the highest yes vote was Victoria. V=
ictorians are also said to be "generally socially progressive, supportive o=
f multiculturalism, wary of extremes of any kind."[14]

Premier Daniel Andrews leads the Australian Labor Party that won the Novemb=
er 2014 Victorian state election.

The centre-left Australian Labor Party (ALP), the centre-right Liberal Part=
y of Australia, the rural-based National Party of Australia, and the enviro=
nmentalist Australian Greens are Victoria's main political parties. Traditi=
onally, Labor is strongest in Melbourne's working class western and norther=
n suburbs, and the regional cities of Ballarat, Bendigo and Geelong. The Li=
berals' main support lies in Melbourne's more affluent eastern and outer su=
burbs, and some rural and regional centres. The Nationals are strongest in =
Victoria's North Western and Eastern rural regional areas. The Greens, who =
won their first lower house seats in 2014, are strongest in inner Melbourne=
.
Federal government


Victoria is incorporated into 79 municipalities for the purposes of local g=
overnment, including 39 shires, 32 cities, seven rural cities and one borou=
gh. Shire and city councils are responsible for functions delegated by the =
Victorian parliament, such as city planning, road infrastructure and waste =
management. Council revenue comes mostly from property taxes and government=
 grants.[15]

Melbourne, the state capital, is home to more than three in four Victorians=
.

The 2011 Australian census reported that Victoria had 5,354,042 people resi=
dent at the time of the census.[16] The Australian Bureau of Statistics est=
imates that the population may well reach 7.2 million by 2050.

Victoria's founding Anglo-Celtic population has been supplemented by succes=
sive waves of migrants from southern and eastern Europe, Southeast Asia and=
, most recently, the Horn of Africa and the Middle East. Victoria's populat=
ion is ageing in proportion with the average of the remainder of the Austra=
lian population.

About 72% of Victorians are Australian-born. This figure falls to around 66=
% in Melbourne but rises to higher than 95% in some rural areas in the nort=
h west of the state. Around two-thirds of Victorians claim Australian, Scot=
tish, English or Irish ancestry. Less than 1% of Victorians identify themse=
lves as Aboriginal. The largest groups of people born outside Australia cam=
e from the British Isles, China, Italy, Vietnam, Greece and New Zealand.

More than 75% of Victorians live in Melbourne, located in the state's south=
. The greater Melbourne metropolitan area is home to an estimated 4.17 mill=
ion people.[17] Leading urban centres outside Melbourne include Geelong, Ba=
llarat, Bendigo, Shepparton, Mildura, Warrnambool, W
