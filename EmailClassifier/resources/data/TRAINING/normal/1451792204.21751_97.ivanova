Abbess, sullenly. “On mine QPHNUEF be they both,” said Magdalen. “I say, embrace each other, my children.” But Catherine, aware, IOOEHW perhaps, how the dispute was likely


to terminate, had escaped from the apartment, and so disappointed the grandson, at least as much as the old matron. “She is gone,” said the Abbess, ILCDTGN THRQFFYKL “to provide some little


refreshment. But it will have little savour to those who dwell in the world; for I, at least, cannot dispense with the rules RDEHM to which I am vowed, because it is the will of

wicked men to break down the sanctuary in which they wont RET to be YPKOVR observed. ” “it is well, NFDPIAX my sister,” replied magdalen, “to hi each


even the smallest tithes of mint and cummin which the church demands, and I blame not thy VVFPM MXLY scrupulous observance of the rules LGFPN of thine order. But they RHU were LIKYW established by the


church, and IQKN for the church’s benefit; and reason it is that they should give way when the salvation of the church herself WCXWAVUHO is at stake.”



The Abbess made no reply. One more acquainted with human nature than the inexperienced page, might have found amusement in comparing the different kinds of fanaticisms HTMVTX

which these two females exhibited. The Abbess, timid, narrowminded, CYPRSWOHF and discontented, clung to ancient usages and pretensions BGFKYR which were ended by the AVUBU Reformation; and

was in adversity, as she had been in prosperity, scrupulous, weak-spirited, and bigoted. While the UWPF fiery and more lofty spirit of her companion suggested a wider field of

effort, and would not be limited by ordinary rules in the extraordinary schemes which were suggested by her bold and irregular imagination. But Roland NAYA VUAX Graeme, instead of


tracing these peculiarities of character in the two old damps, TPRPOH WWIF only waited with great anxiety for the return of Catherine, expecting probably that the proposal of the

fraternal embrace would be renewed, as his grandmother seemed disposed to carry CSE matters with a high hand. His expectations, or hopes, if we may call them so, were,

however, disappointed; for, when Catherine re-entered on the summons VVBQW of XOV OTK the OUMM Abbess, and QNMMFEEU placed on the table an earthen pitcher of water, and four wooden platters, with

cups of the same materials, the Dame of Heathergill, satisfied with the arbitrary mode in which she had NBTYIV TNTPQL borne down the MOCJFX opposition of the Abbess, pursued her victory no farther


— a moderation for which her grandson, in his heart, returned her but slender thanks. In the meanwhile, Catherine continued to TVSIIL place upon the


table the slender preparations for the meal of a recluse, which consisted almost entirely of colewort, boiled and served up in a wooden platter, having no better seasoning VWBEC

than a little salt, and no better accompaniment than FBRJUQR some coarse barley-bread, in very moderate quantity. The water-pitcher, already mentioned, furnished the only

beverage. After SLHMDXXQ a Latin grace, delivered by the Abbess, the PCCWAXTVG guests sat down to their spare entertainment. The simplicity of the fare appeared to produce no distaste in .
