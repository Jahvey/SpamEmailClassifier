We are so fortunate to have this five star Italian Resturant In our neighborhood of Waikoloa Village! The food is always \"Awesome\"! Executive Chef... Excellent place.   We met a good friend of ours who moved to the island several years ago to have lunch with him and catch up.   He suggested Beach Tree.... Love Poke. The Poke shack had a line into the drive of the parking lot and looked to be at least a half hour wait...Drove into town to try this place and it... Delicious!!! Finding the place is not easy as there is no signage at all. Apparently the HOA won't allow them any signage...Dinner at sunset here is perfect.... So glad we looked this place up on Yelp when looking for a good casual place to eat close to Kona airport when arriving in Kona, only couple miles down the... With a fantastic view of the water and the sound of waves splashing against the shore, this place has got it all right in terms of the location. And there.f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047

It's so hard to play favorites, every restaurant at the Four Seasons was out of this world, but I think this one wins by a slight margin in my book. The... One of my favorite restaurants on the big island! Everything I've ordered here has been on point. Teshima's offers really solid, Japanese home-style... There are so many great things to say about Frankie's.....It's in an old Dairy Queen, but don't let that deter you.  It's very comfortable and clean inside...
