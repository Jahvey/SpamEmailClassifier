Steak bites..Calamari..Happy hour drinks....There are a lot of other good foods here too!..Hope they keep getting better...Service is friendly and great! I'm a sushi snob. I love the the right ponzu on my toro (fatty tuna) and flavored that causes my taste buds to cry out in sheer ecstasy. This place is... I love korean food... And this is one of the best places I've been to. Though a bit pricier than most korean places, it has a decent amount per serving and... Great food and better service. If you would like some consistent good Italian food this is the spot. Salad is always great and main courses are even better!... Best place to pick up your sushi to go. ..Prompt and friendly service. ..Always fresh and innovative. ..Take it home and relax with cold sake. I came here on a Monday night around 7:30 and was seated immediately. Service was fast and friendly but nothing extraordinary. I ordered chicken pad thai... Gref8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
