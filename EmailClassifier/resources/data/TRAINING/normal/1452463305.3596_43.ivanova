Re: Trump's plan for American's to double-their-income from home, 7023736, exclusively here: http://joinnow.actionsfurther.review/learnhow

This place is hands down one of my favorite spots in Evansville. I can't speak for all of the menu but the Sauerbraten is delicious. The portions are large.... I tend to enjoy places that  don't care about your assumptions or expectations.  As people have said before, the outside of this restaurant would have you... Great classic steaks.  Had a great prime rib with mushrooms and a Cesar salad...Great old time atmosphere ...Drinks were generous and service was on the spot. Love all there food! The peanut brittle salad is amazing \u0026 neatly crafted!! The ambiance in the bar area with the pianist is pretty romantic for a date... This place is really good.   Their sushi is very fresh.  I could usually tell from their ikura, not fishy at all.  Their service is very good, close to... Wednesday night 8/26/15 first time here. Heard it was great. Pretty much was with only a couple exception. Bread was only acceptablef8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
