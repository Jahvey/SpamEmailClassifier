I'm a native New Yorker and have been buying breakfast like bacon, egg \u0026 cheese for years. I now work in the area so I gave them a try and this was by far...

Getting food from them since I moved to Bridgeport. Fast, good food and they have not messed my order up once in over 3 years. Can't recommend this place enough.
