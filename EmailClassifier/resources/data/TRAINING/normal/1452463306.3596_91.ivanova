Friendly staff and great food.  Try the Prime Rib! Also the ground round is outstanding.  Salad bar is excellent. For Chinese food in Iowa, Sum Hing is one of the best.....They have a large menu and their lunch special is the best deal in town!....Go for the Orange Chicken... This restaurant is in the Northbridge Mall.....Food is good and portions are large. We usually eat half and take the rest home to make another meal. If you... Their Green Chile Smothered Burrito is incredible. I was really impressed. Good corn bread too. Their staff needs a little work but everyone was still... Great pancakes.  Good breakfast.  Prompt service.  Fair prices.  Not a chain.....There need to be more like Buds! I had the opportunity to try the Green Mill in Albert Lea again on Father's Day. They posted a Prime Rib special.  I took a chance and ordered the Prime... Ate here for lunch after being unable to find a single breakfast joint still open by 11 am (yes I realize that's late, but I'm on vacation). Our waitress... I am giving this place five stars because a) the food really was very good, and b) it is totally unexpected to find a place like this in Jasper, GA.... I don't often rave about restaurants, however this will be an exception to the rule. The atmosphere and food in 61 Main was out of this world and only... Very good experience. The pulled pork was mild but pleasantly woody. Service was prompt and friendly. Bathroom was clean. Delicious hometown country food. Friendly staff, yummy food. Homemade cathead biscuits!!!! I visited Quick Burger along with my husband and 5 year old daughter this past Saturday.  We took a day trip up to Big Canoe/Jasper area.  I found Quick... The foods great and the customer service is great one things they are missing  is the menu Great steak biscuit. But what was better was the company. Being in a small town it was nice to see how everyone knew each other. They also were very warm... Both my husband and I agreed that our meals were fabulous. I didn't see salmon on the menu and that's what I really wanted.  The sweet waitress \"Brandi\"... Food was great, and as it was our first time they brought out some samples of their chicken to try, it was pretty good. The poppy seed bread was amazing,...f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
