My friend's parents rented this place out a couple of years ago for my friend's 30th birthday party...From beginning to end, the whole event was a massive...

Their garlic chicken is ridiculous good - make sure you ask for extra sauce on the side, you will thank me later!... Clearly one of the best evenings we have had in quite awhile. Fernando is Amazing and his knowledge of wines are top notch. We basically picked the food and... Yes! Get ready to ring in 2016 with carbs my babies, because this place is legit! We had just come from hiking Solstice Canyon and wanted to grab a quick... oh MAN, i hardly give five stars to sushi places unless it is Sugarfish. This place is mind blowing. The sushi here is just amazing. I didn't get a chance... I had promised to come back here to try a more traditional dish and kept true to my word.  Must say, second time around was the charm in this case.  ....First... I cannot rave enough about this restaurant.

We came through s few months ago and did not stop, but after reading the reviews, while in town again we decided to try it.  My husband ordered the boneless... WOW! Quaint, Unique, a Gem! I just finished up eating breakfast at this little gem, and I have to say I'm very impressed. It's a very unassuming spot, but trust me, you're going to...f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
