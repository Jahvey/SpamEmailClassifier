Hello Dear, 
 
I am sorry for contacting you through this medium without any previous notice. I am a senior staff with Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation, (NNPC). My colleagues and I intentionally over-invoiced a contract award to the tune of USD50M. All arrangements have been concluded on how to transfer this fund into a safe foreign account after the original contractor has been fully paid. By virtue of our Civil service code of conduct, serving officers are not allowed to Operate foreign bank accounts.
 
This is why I am seeking your mutual involvement to work with me in getting the over-invoiced sum USD50M transferred into your foreign Bank account for our benefit. Please indicate your interest via email hence other modalities will be discussed. There is no risk involved and the fund transfer will have full legal backup.
 
Please treat with utmost confidentiality.
 
Best Regard,
 
Mr. Koffy Ange.
