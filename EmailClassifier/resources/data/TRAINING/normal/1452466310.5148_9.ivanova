Greetings bruce@untroubled.org,

An retired CIA officer just revealed the ONLY self-defense tool he needs with him to protect himself at all times.

It fits in your pocket and is as deadly as a gun... and you are able to take it on a plane. It is completely legal!

It's only one of over 101 spy secrets that he is revealing to the public today in one FREE book.

Unfortunately, he only has 250 to give out today. But you are still able to claim yours today!

Go here now to claim your free copy and keep yourself protected at all times: http://findout.leadingoath.cricket/checkitout


To your safety,

Douglas Hawkins

Director, Laissez Faire Club

Rube's Steakhouse is the best place to get a steak in Iowa, and perhaps the entire country.  It's that good.....I've been to a lot of places that sell steaks,... We are from out of town so we took a chance on this place. Outward and inward appearance the building doesn't look like anything special. But the food in... Great pizza!  Lots of cheese, which is great for me, but maybe not for all. We had them deliver, but they're like 15 minutes away from the hotel where I was... Pat the owner is very nice and always wants to catch up, even if I sometimes can't understand her :)..Her pad thai (chicken with noodles and peanut sauce) is... We love The Tremont. The food is always excellent and the service is as good as the food. Nice atmosphere and located in a small town in central Iowa where... Lots of well aged meat cuts to pick from. You  can even call ahead with a order and they will have it ready for you. Great place to get some great grilling... Sadly, the Taco Johns chain no longer allows the Marshalltown branch to serve french fries (BOY!! Do we all miss those!!) or their great frozen yogurt.... El Portal is, and has been for a long time, a solid choice to eat in Marshalltown.  Let's get something out of the way first, El Portal does not sell... Marshalltown is a town that at one time, had many great restaurants and eating establishments.  Due to changing demographics, that number has dwindled over... Awesome spot to grab a drink and munch on yummy food. Also, great service. Only thing is the prices. Bit on the expensive side but its great food, service,... The best ribeye I've had in a long time! All of the food was delicious and the hospitality was wonderful! I have lived in Heber Springs for over 13 years and I will say that Mack's is one of those restaurants that offers good fresh food with servers who are... I am a HUGE fan of Mexican food! Let me just say, this restaurant is amazing and deserves all five stars! Very good food, excellent service, great scenery.... Newly rebuilt and open!....Update they tore down the building and are building a new restaurant looks like it will be open soon.  I'm guessing around Aug... We went there for dinner on Black Friday and it was really great. We tried all the wing flavors. Really good. And we split a large meat calzone that was... Food ok. Service slow. Has to wait almost an hour to get our steak. Probably wouldn't eat here again the coffee is excellent -- was an enjoyable stop on my trip to heber springs last year.   Very enjoyable coffee in a time of caffeinated need.  ....Will stop... Ate lunch here on 7-30-15. Very good!  Has lunch specials and regular menu items. Atmosphere is invitingly rustic. Wait staff is great and very helpful....f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
