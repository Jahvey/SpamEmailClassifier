What a joy to eat in a restaurant where the ingredients are respected and taken care of. ..Dinning out by yourself can be a difficult experience but when... Outstanding atmosphere! Incredible service! Kristen was amazing, and very helpful!! The Pot-roast Nacho appetizer  was amazing. The Bison burger was on... The Best Ribs I have had in a long time. Excellent rub, smoked great and tender pull off the bone and dip in sauce if you like. They are served with sauce... Just finished a delish \"greedy girl cuisine\" of cheesesticks and ice cream. This place is great. The cheesesticks are fresh and gooey with whf8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
