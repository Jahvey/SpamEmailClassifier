Two words: beet cosmo! It's rare for me to be completely surprised by a cocktail as I've been studying the art of ingesting cocktails for many years now.... This restaurant is why we go out to eat! The variety of seats allows for a business meeting, a romantic evening, or a deeply satisfying meal... It was very reasonably priced and service was quick!! Food came out in less than five minutes (granted there wasn't too many other people there) however... Wow.  It's rare that anything deserves the word \"Wow\", but this word actually came out of my mouth when I dropped by Surly Brewing for the first time this... Made reservations here due to receiving a gift card for Christmas. We decided to have dinner before seeing a show, so we were there exceptionally early (I'm...
