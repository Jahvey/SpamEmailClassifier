Obama is Risking 45-Million U.S Lives Every Day
=====================================================
This banned video will be taken down Jan. 14, 2016.

American Citizen bruce@untroubled.org,

Obama's latest disaster seems to be destroying Hillary's presidential campaign.

This one is even worse than the failure that is ObamaCare.

A recently released video has revealed the biggest government conspiracy in U.S history!

Yes, bigger than Watergate, and bigger than Monica Lewinsky!

Democrats are doing whatever they can to keep this video under wraps, and save Hillary's campaign.

Go here now to see this video before Obama has it taken down forever: http://checknow.aboutpack.eu


To the Truth,

Jennifer Thompson
CFO, HSI


P.S. Obama and Hillary plan on keeping control of the White House, but this video could destroy their plans.
