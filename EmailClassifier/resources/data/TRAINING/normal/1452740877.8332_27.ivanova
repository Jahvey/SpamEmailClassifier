Maxim: What Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson does for 6 pack abs in 1 month, exclusively here-- http://actnow.yellowears.eu/grabit

My boyfriend and I ate here exclusively on our recent trip to the Pictured Rocks area. If you're reading this review odds are you know there's not much in... One word...Delicious! ....I have had several things off of the menu and have never been disappointed! The fries are fresh cut and the dogs...yum! Great to... West Bay Diner has all the charm and quirks that you expect from a small-town locals joint. And towns don't get much smaller than Grand Marais!....Went here... Awesome, even more so after a 14 mile hike, rain, and 29* temps.....Had a grilled cheese, chicken noodle soup and a Mocha.....All were better than expected and... Stopped here for breakfast on the second day of our camping trip and had a great experience. Kelly was alone, serving \u0026 cooking all by her lonesome with 3... Generous portions, service was a tad slow (but the restaurant was busy). Atmosphere was fine, would definitely eat here again. I can recommend the pizzaf8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047

Keep in perspective that this is Munising, not Chicago. We went there for drinks and some food and I'm not going to go on and on about what we liked and... Nice spot for dinner! ....My husband and I come to the UP each year for skiing. We can never find food in munising and always end up stopping at the holiday... On a Sunday night, not much is open past 8p but a run into town for pizza proved to be a good move. The breadsticks were amazing! ....My husband ordered some...
