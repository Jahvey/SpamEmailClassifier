Girlfriends and I went to Wis Dells for a girls weekend, and when we saw Mac's pictures, we had... A cute yet vintage restaurant, the environment of The Cheeze Factory was both warm and welcoming, and the service was superb. ..The Rattlesnake tofu was full... Best taco salads , pork tacos and margaritas  hands down...love love love the authentic decorations..service is always spot on and they have fun with...
