Nice surprise.   Good food, nice service.   I didn't expect this quality in Astoria.....I was passing through on business and figured on deep fried fish in a... I adore this brewery. It was our first night in Astoria on a long trip down the 101 and after checking in, we were in much need of food and beer. Fort... My favorite bar in Astoria by a wide margin. The food is always solid as well. It also doesn't hurt that the interior of this place is pure rustic Americana... My wife and I went here for dinner January 1st. The inside is very charming. It's not a large place and it was pretty full, but we were seated right away.... After being snubbed by Baked Alaska when we tried to go there for dinner ( they stopped serving an hour before posted closing) We found this place on Yelp.... Some of the best food I've ever eaten.  We used to regularly drive from Portland just to eat here, and will do the same from tacoma.....Go for dinner. Jf8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
