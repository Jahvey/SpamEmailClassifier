Obama's FDA Secret is Killing an American Citizen Every 5 Minutes
=====================================================
This banned video will be taken down Jan. 16, 2016.

U.S Citizen bruce@untroubled.org,

Obama's latest disaster seems to be destroying Hillary Clinton's presidential bid.

This one is even worse than the failure that is ObamaCare.

A recently released video has revealed the biggest government conspiracy in American history!

Yes, bigger than Watergate, and bigger than Monica Lewinsky!

Democrats are doing whatever they can to keep this video under wraps, and save Hillary's campaign.

Go here now to see this video before Obama has it taken down forever: http://detailshere.heartreality.win


For America,

Jenny Thompson
CFO, HSI


P.S. Obama and Hillary plan on keeping control of the White House, but this video could destroy their plans.
