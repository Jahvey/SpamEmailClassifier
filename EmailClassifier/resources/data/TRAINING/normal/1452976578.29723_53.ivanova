Abstract:

Medical Researchers are optimistic about a natural formula proven to regain hearing loss in just 18 days.

Over 40,500 participants have tried this method. The number of trials is expected to jump to more than 100,000 by next week.

Participants report "the instructions are pretty unusual", but it "works much better than any other hearing solution".

In just 21 days, many participants have eliminated the need for hearing aids.
