I've come here a handful of times by myself and with friends and family, leaving happy and satisfied each time. Wings are excellent here, as well as some sort of pizza bread we had as appetizers.  Prices are good and bartenders are very friendly.  Great place to stop... Totally Awsome experience here in Langhorne.....We love the food and familia way better then Brothers... I wasn't that impressed. I went to this restaurant after reading all of these rave reviews, and what I found was a very generic Asian food restaurant. Went... This place is such a gem! On the long drive between climbing destinations, this was a welcome respite. ....The food was great (definitely recommend the chips)... This is a great little gem right of the highway. It's got a cozy atmosphere and quick service. We had a large group, and they gave us pitchers of beverages... Smooth sailing at dinner with friendly, prompt service, good wine, and good food. We wandered over from the Best Western for dinner. The front desk at BW... Black Sheep is currently my favorite restaurant in the Orem/Provo area. My husband and I are split on whether this title belongs to Oteo or Black Sheep, but... Really great restaurant find in Provo. Very fresh, flavorful dishes. With the family style sharing, you get to try lots of different stuff. Highlights were... Eat this food! You will not regret it. ....I got the steak and avocado sandwich, and it was insane. This is easily one of the best restaurants in Utah Valley.....Great service, and the food is amazing. It is some of the most delicious food you will ever... I had a previous review on here that I decided to delete. I have since eaten here a few times since so I feel I can write a better review about it. ....I... this is more an experience than anything else. you walk into the restaurant-- in which the ambiance is minimalistic and mostly red. ....you're immediately......f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047 </span></p>
