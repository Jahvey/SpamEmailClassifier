First time visit. Arrived later in the evening.  Ordered a half rack, fries and onion rings. Ribs are dry rubbed. No smoke detected. Even though... I rate this restaurant 5 stars based on other restaurants around the area. If your in this town, this place will be your best bet. Large variety and great food. I love Joes! The food is good and so is the staff! Great place to have lunch (check their lunch specials!) or have dinner with your family. No other restaurants can compare to theirs! I have never had any crab Rangoon's that even come close! This is the best place in town! Mongolian beef is must!! I used to work here and love this little gem on the Wabash! Voted Best Pancakes in the Wabash Valley by WTHI Fork in the Road crew! Daily specials, amazing... since our last visit..the Bistro catered our firefighter assn. meeting a few days ago....once again..food EXCELLENT....service EXCELLENT!
