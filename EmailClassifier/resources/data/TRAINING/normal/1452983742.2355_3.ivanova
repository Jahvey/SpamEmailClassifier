Forbes: How Donald Trump Turned into the Quickest Thinker on the planet, exclusively here-- http://joinnow.terraceup.eu/gohere

Great food and selection of beers on tap. Also, cleaner and more kept up than expected (no sticky floors!). We went for lunch and got the smoked turkey BBQ... The best restaurant in LaSalle or Livingston county. Great menu, great service and reasonable prices. You won't leave hungry. We were in Streator to visit family and really enjoyed this place. The service was good and friendly. The food was delicious and the prices were extremely... The perfectly classic American diner. Superb breakfast served all day, the famous homemade pie, and great small-town service add up to a must-visit in... Some things never change and I'm glad this is one of them. Been around for a long time. Truly a classic and don't change a thing!  Quality toppings friendly... Mojito's is ran by my good friend Rosie and combines Italian and Mexican Cuisine.   It is a sit down restuarant open for lunch and dinner with prices... The owner isf8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047

This is a great bar that offers great food. This is a local bar that has tons of friendly regulars. The Pork Tenderloin sandwich is amazing and they also... Yummy, yummy pizza! We're lucky to have something so good so close being out in Fate!  My husband says he still likes Papa John's better, but I prefer Mona... Best pulled pork in the USA. 2nd choice would be the brisket tacos.....This place is a little hard to find definately worth drive. Many people on here know of the unholy coupling that is a Taqueria Gas station combo, they are my kryptonite. Whist making a liquor run to Sigel's down Hwy... Best beef fajita anywhere.  I keep wanting to try one of the many other meats available but I never do because the beef is so darn good.  We cook it on a... AMAZING BBQ!!!! Cozy atmosphere. Great service. I had a party at my house and they showed up promptly at my requested time. Everyone loved the food and I... This is one of my favorite places in Texas.  It's inexpensive (especially for a steak dinner) and has a great house band and dance floor.  One note is that... For some reason there isn't a lot of Carls Jr's in the Dallas area. The ones I have been to are either at a Loves Truck stop (like this one) or random stand...
