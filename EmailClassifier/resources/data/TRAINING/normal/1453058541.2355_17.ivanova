I've been coming here with every out of town guest and no matter the wait, it's 100% worth it. We played with the jukebox during our 30-45 minute wait, took... Amazing breakfast! ..We stopped over here looking to eat at IHOP or Dennys before heading to the zoo. Both were packed so we went in Tacos Chinampa bc we saw... Horrible service tonight! We went there for my son's birthday dinner (he was dying for some smores), however, we sat there for 10mins without anyone giving... Really good authentic Mexican food. Good portions, and low prices. The service was the best I have seen at a restaurant in a long time. The restaurant looks... Probably the cleanest and nicest Vietnamese restaurant I've ever been in... They have their own waterfall and 40 foot lazy river filled with Koi ....I had a...

The staff are awesome and they are friendly.  I have tried almost everything on the menu here and I would recommend sharing some bites... Great place to grab lunch or dinner. I am totally a fan of the double dip wings. There are a lot of great items on the menu but I just cannot go without... Sunday morning brunch is probably one of the most fulfilling things in the world. After a night out in Mankato, in last night's dried sweat clothes, we... Such a neat little place! There are taps all over the walls right as you walk in, giving it a very fun, laid-back, pub-style vibe. Our waitress was lovely....
