We stopped for a quick lunch as we were traveling through town.  We weren't real hungry but mainly just interested in getting a little to eat at this... Awesome location and ambiance. I had the fish tacos and they were the best that I had the week I was there. My husband had the Jambalaya and said it was... The food was very good - had the salmon special, east meets west and domo arrogato - and everyone liked their food.  Soup and salad weren't particularly... Just wonderful!

Pete's has survived while others have come and gone due to it following a basic formula.  Great food, great portions, friendly wait staff.  I ordered 2... My favorite restaurant of all time! I grew up in Winston Salem and this is the first place I want to go when I get back in town. My parents would laugh when... I love this place for seafood near Winston.  I always go at off-times though, because it can get pretty crowded!  There aren't tables - it's just bar... We have eaten here on 2 occasions and both meals were spectacular and the staff is very friendly.....On this visit I went with the Grilled Meatloaf topped... Hands down! The # 1 Barbecue choice anytime I travel through NC on Interstate 85! I recently completed a four day trek through my old NC stomping grounds... The fried chicken is delicious! The tomato gravy it comes with is so different and unique. Looking through the reviews I'm confused why they don't have 5 stars? Reviews raving about the food and service and then only 4 stars? That's confusing....f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
