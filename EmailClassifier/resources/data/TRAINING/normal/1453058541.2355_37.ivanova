Playboy: Chris Hemsworth's simple "Thor" workout, exclusively here: http://visitnow.trustythu.eu/trynow

I hadn't eaten at The Friend's Grill before because we always eat at Mama Chole's, but they were packed and I had wanted to try this place and I'm certainly... I have been fortunate enough to visit the Laurel Tree  on 3 separate occasions, each time exceeded my expectations.  The ambiance is perfect, the food is... When my husband and I go hiking or to small towns, gourmet food is not something expect. I expect some county fried steak and good burgers. when they told... Fantastic place.  Great atmosphere.  Neat little town with a gem of a restaurant.  We had Mac n cheese, cabrito chili, and quail tacos for dinner.  Brussel... OMG... I just had the best soup ever (Italian Wedding Soup)!!!   We're in Kerrville for the Triathlon festival and wanted to try a new place... ....Wow...... Concan isn't really near anything unless you're camping at Garner. If you're out that way, though, please go - it's totally worth the drive..f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
