Abstract:

Ear specialists are optimistic about a natural formula proven to restore hearing loss in just 3 weeks.

More than 40,000 study participants have used this method. The number of trials is anticipate to jump to more than 100,000 by next 7 days.

Participants admit "the instructions are pretty strange", but it "works far better than any other hearing solution".

In just 3 weeks, many participants have eliminated the need for hearing aids.
