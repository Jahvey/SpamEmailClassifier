Tesla-Technology Used to Create No-Gas Engine
=========================================
Patent No. 21785405
Publication Date:  01/17/16

bruce@untroubled.org, 

More than 180 years ago... Robert Stirling, a Scottish clergyman invented something that shook the coal and energy industry to the ground.

Stirling found a way to make an engine work literally on thin air using Tesla Power.

Unfortunately, his device became the first-ever suppressed 'free energy' generator. Only a few people had ever seen it.

Now, for the first time, the 'misplaced' blueprints of the Stirling Engine have been discovered and translated into 'plain English' so anyone can use them.

Go here to see how Elon Musk incorporated this technology to make the remarkable Tesla Battery Packs--  http://watchhere.zonelittle.webcam/discover
