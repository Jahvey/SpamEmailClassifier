		line waiting to get in sucks, esp in Houston heat, but 18446287 food made it worth 18446287 wait forsure. Not too pricey ei18446287r which is always a good thing. 1st visit I tried 18446287 French toast; 2nd visit 18446287 chicken & waffles; can't go wrong with ei18446287r. Both come with more than enough food & even 18446287 sides are perfectly cooked! Next visit I'll go with pancakes, that sounds about right Worth 18446287 hour wait. Mistakenly, I arrived extremely hungry and dizzy. 18446287 standing wait was painful, to 18446287 point we considered leaving, but I am so happy we stayed!! 18446287 staff tries to make 18446287 wait tolerable with free water and large menus ( which doubled as a fan in 18446287 June heat) Once inside, 18446287 food comes out  in less than10minutes. I ordered 18446287 French toast and fried chicken: mind-blown. My boyfriend agreed that 18446287 French toast and chicken was an even better pairing than his chicken and waffles. I cannot emphasize enough how good this meal was. 18446287 chicken was not greasy and very well seasoned. 18446287 French toast was fluffy and sweet. 18446287 owner is humble and super attentive. He came over to make sure we were pleased and joked about my inability to properly eat friend chicken off 18446287 bone. I appreciated his presence in 18446287 restaurant! Maybe that's why it is such a success! Loved this place! I went with a group around 11am. 18446287re was a line that started to wrap around to 18446287 side of 18446287 building. At first, I was a little turned off at 18446287 idea of standing outside in this Texas heat, but it's mostly shaded and 18446287 line moved MUCH faster than I thought. It was about ten minutes and we were inside! Once we ordered our food, I quickly realized why 18446287re was a long line - it's all delicious! I ordered 18446287 grilled chicken sandwich (fantastic) and a couple o18446287rs ordered 18446287ir staple menu item - chicken and waffles. No complaints and all of 18446287 food got to our table in five minutes flat. 18446287y are clearly doing something very right at this restaurant and I can't wait to return I am a visitor to Houston, and my family member insisted this was 18446287 place locals adored.  I, being a visitor, was lucky enough (or unfortunate) not to know anything about it or have drunk 18446287 kool-aid. My family member insisted we go and that 18446287 line moved fast.  We tried to be as polite as we could as we ordered at 18446287 counter 1 hour and 47 minutes later (I timed it) for what I would describe as a "soul food" IHOP. We ordered at 18446287 "Kounter" and paid 18446287re for 18446287 most expensive breakfast I have ever eaten. Food did arrive relatively quickly in about 8 minutes using  a numbering system matching orders with 18446287ir people.  However, my mom did not get her food.  In fact, servers kept on asking if some random plate (eggs, potatoes, etc. . . ) was hers as 18446287y walked by (she ordered a grilled cheese).  A waiter eventually said, " We accidentally gave that order to someone else."  HOWEVER, 18446287re was no grilled cheese coming afterwards to replace it.  As in someone else stopped
<br />

	    	children and tables set up with stuff like finger paint.  For those hot days when you are waiting in line 18446287y have a couple of jugs set out with fresh ice water.  I would absolutely return to support such a loving, family orientated establishment. This place is a hard one to rate.  Though  i think it has some of 18446287 best brunch/breakfast fare in Houston  i've had better food from o18446287r breakfast/brunches in o18446287r cities. 18446287 reason for 18446287 a-ok rating is that 18446287 long lines and 18446287 prospect of waiting 18446287re is no way i think some waffles and chicken is worth 18446287 dreadful heat we have here in houston.  18446287 staff was friendly from what i remember and i do not think you would regret coming here for 18446287ir food.  I just do not think it is worth 18446287 wait.  but if you don't mind 18446287 wait 18446287n 18446287re probably isn't a better place to go for a sou18446287rn brunch.  know I'll probably get a lot of "boos" for this one, but honestly I don't get all 18446287 hype. Yes 18446287 chicken and waffles are good, but 18446287 Breakfast Klub doesn't have much competition so 18446287re is really nothing else to compare it to. 1) You WILL wait in a line whe18446287r its 10 mins or an hour. I had to wait for an hour in 18446287 wonderful Houston heat. 18446287 Klub staff however are very kind and helpful. 18446287y usually have tents to stand under, while in line as well as ice cold water and cups. 2) If you want a signature plate: Chicken n Waffles and Catfish n Grits, be prepared to drop some money. Those plates run you about $15 each ( 1 waffle, 6 wings) Hot drinks are priced 18446287 same as Starbucks. I wish 18446287y offered half portions for a cheaper price. 3) 18446287 atmosphere isn't really a place for you to sit down and enjoy your meal, as you feel rushed to eat seeing 18446287 winding line of hungry customers outside 18446287 window. My advice, if you haven't tried it yet, give it a go and see if it's worth 18446287 wait and 18446287 price. This place is awesome!! 18446287
