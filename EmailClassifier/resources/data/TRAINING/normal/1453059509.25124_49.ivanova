		   Are you looking for private jet charters? We only require a call at least 5 hours in advance, and we will have the jet of your choice waiting at your local airport. V1 Private Jets will have a limousine pick you up from your location, and have another one waiting for you when you land at your destination. Your flight will be absolutely seamless, even with a gourmet meal prepared for you on the flight. Instead of hassling with the wait and crowds associated with commercial flights, let V1 Private Jets' award-winning concierge and service team cater to your specified requests on your next flight on one of our private jet charters. Wondering how we do it? V1 Private Jets is leading the private aviation industry with our reservation bidding technology. To you, it's known as convenience and efficiency. For us, it is a revolutionary way of running private jet charters.  MediaJet, a newsstand found in private airports nationwide, is capturing the attention of ultra-affluent travelers by monopolizing the space with exclusive publications. Launched in 2009 by parent company Sandow, MediaJet provides high-end publications to 7.8 million discerning travelers who are frequently in and out of private jet terminals. To match the sentiments of these readers, MediaJet places only imprints that properly align with the exclusive lifestyle of private jet travelers. ???Whether it???s a $2 million or $50 million jet owner, it???s a great audience for luxury brands,??? said Mike Ruskin, president of MediaJet, Boca Raton, FL. ???These are people who can afford to fly private; they???re not going through regular commercial airports,??? he said. ???Money is no object ??? if they see a piece of jewelry, a car, a yacht that they like, they have the disposable income to purchase it.???

When first launched, MediaJet only carried imprints published by Sandow. Sandow publications include Watch Journal, Luxe Interiors + Design, Worth and NewBeauty. Our magazines speak to a very specific audience and we needed to make sure that happens,???  Mr. Ruskin said. ???That is why we built this network. ???We have a controlled circulation model that is designed to get our magazines into the hands of an uber-affluent audience,??? he said. ???The external partners that will be part of MediaJet are not driven by subscriptions either so this offers a great marketing opportunity for their goods and services to luxury consumers.??? By only including Sandow???s own publications, MediaJet was able to build its own brand recognition and drive interest for the marketing partners found within the advertising space of those imprints. Recently, MediaJet has opened up its newsstand to outside publications to give its consumers more of a range. Outside partners include magazines and collateral materials. MediaJet limits its outside partner spaces to only 10 spots per newsstand to ensure a sense of quality-control. The publications and marketing partners that have been included on
