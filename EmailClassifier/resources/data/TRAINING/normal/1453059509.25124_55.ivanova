		  leaders who expertly represented what we had all come to share in Alaska. In their early 30s, both men were blessed with an ability to communicate their excitment and knowledge with a great sense of humor. No question or discussion point phased either of them! 	 Our naturalist Jon Ciser's illustrated presentations on marine life revealed fascinating insights about Steller sea lions, Orca (known world-wide as killer whales even though they are dolphins!), harbor seals, sea otters and of course, humpback whales -- the stars of any wildlife show. Whether learning about them in the forward lounge with a pre-dinner drink in hand or out on deck for hours with binoculars in hand, we all thrilled to the antics of the whales that frequently surrounded the Admiralty Dream, as it dropped to a low idle for an hour or two allowing guests to take in this spectacle in the silence of the moment. While feeding, diving with graceful tail flips or full-body breaching into the air, the natural agility was astonishing, knowing that these whales average 46 feet/14 meters in length and 80,000 pounds/36,500 kilograms. Serving a native cultural ambassador role, our Tlingit expedition leader, Lee Vale, proved to be a talented storyteller and font of environmental knowledge interpreted from an indigenous perspective. Recounting tales of his childhood so different from the life of an average North American child, he shared with equal ease traditional stories from his community that explain the ways of nature, the animals of land, sea and air, and the foibles of humanity. Through Lee's eyes, the rich cultural heritage of the Tlingit people sprang to life, and our shore visits to villages and towns where Tlingit culture was a significant part of the itinerary were all the more appreciated. The view from the top of Mount Roberts is outstanding. To the south, Alaska???s inside passage and to the north, the tip of the Mendenhall Glacier. It was hard to believe we had boarded the MS Amsterdam a scant two days ago. The seven-day cruise from Vancouver to Alaska is a popular adventure - lots of people do it - but until we took the plunge last fall, my wife and I were cruiser newbies, unfamiliar with anything larger than the Queen of Nanaimo. We feared the worst: small staterooms, forced conversation around the dinner table, amateur entertainment; you get the idea. Besides why would we want to go to Alaska when we live in supernatural BC? Surely, the scenery couldn???t be any more spectacular. Happily, curiosity trumped trepidation and the trip not only dispelled our preconceptions but made us Alaska fans as well. We visited three coastal communities on our tour, each one distinct from the other but tied together by a common history, the Klondike Gold Rush.  First stop, Juneau, the state capital. Juneau is notable for its many jewelry shops ??? today, tanzanite, not gold, is the favoured mineral - the Juneau Ice Field and a gondola ride to hiking trails atop Mount Roberts. Helicopters carry tourists to nearby Mendenhall glacier. They???ll even touch down for a brisk walkabout, if you want. We cooled our heels at the local coffee shop. ???It gets pretty quiet around here in the off-season,??? said our barista, underscoring the importance of the tourist trade upon the area. Nowhere was that more apparent than in Skagway, our second
