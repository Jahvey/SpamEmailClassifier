Hi. 

I know what I want from life, from men ... I am a romantic and sweet woman, who is dreaming about clean and true love. 

ID:5580982. http://vinubace.binhoster.com I am beautiful, caring and friendly person. 
I like to spend time in nature and to admire simple things. I like sunsets and sunrises sun, waterfalls and rocks. 

Also I like walks and spending time with friends. I would like to meet a goodhearted, and kind man. I guess it's you? 
Regards, Roksolana.
