Wonderful service from Michael, friendly staff. As always Olive Garden is a wonderful meal. We eat here when traveling through Montgomery on occasion and... Roadhouse style bar we visited on a Thursday with a small group. ....Big open spaces with a stage for live music. ....We happened to get there during happy hour... Updating because the cold part was my error.  I didn't realize there were three kinds of bimbambip The first time I've been to this place was here in Montgomery, AL.  I have to say the food was very good.  I ordered a #1 and that was some kind of chicken... BAUMHOWERS-new name of restaurant.  New menu, but printed on dark green background and impossible to read in dark restaurant lighting.  Wings-ok, but... A great find in the town of Winters!
