I have been here a dozen times or more, they have good entertainment on week-ends,  small bar area, nice outdoor patio. I have had good dinners and have had...

This place is not only off the hook but it's off the chain!!!..Was treated here for belated birthday and was thrilled!..FYI: Upscale, if you're grunge this... Very good pasta and Italian dishes.  Not really one of those authentic mom \u0026 pop places, think \"Bravo.\"....There is regularly a line to be seated and beware:... Decent selection of beers and wines, I had the small patty's and they are juicy and delicious. Scratch kitchen with those brioche bread slices as buns are... One of the best dining experiences we have had in a looooong time!  From the food to the service to the cocktail/craft beer, everything was impeccable.  In... I got the mustang sandwich tonight and it was incredible! Probably one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. It's a meatloaf sandwich with cheddar cheese... Went there for dinner on a Saturday night. The service was friendly and prompt. The nachos, taco salad and flan were delicious.....The place is simple, cheap... When I think about Amici's, I think about America; I think about the family dog and pleasing my wife. I think about sail boating, and taking the kids to see... The meals are huge.  Price is modest.  Service is friendly. I shall go back for more.....Hot and sour soup was very good.  Spring rolls can be a bit crisper. Healthy and delicious vegan food in West Medford. I got the Moqueca , a yummy plate loaded with kale, tofu, carrots and onions in a flavorful coconut sauce....f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
