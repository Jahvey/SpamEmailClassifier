My wife took me to Chef \u0026 the Farmer as a surprise birthday present. We did not have a reservation until 9:45pm, so we had appetizers at The Boiler Room,... I should preface this by saying that I am obsessed, obsessed I tell you, with the show. Boiler Room is every bit as good as I'd hoped it would be. They were... What can you say about Ed's? It's a great experience start to finish- you can't beat the ambiance, and their food is fresh and local. I'm a Goldsboro native... Excellent Pizza and Customer Service. This is the best Pizza restaurant in Goldsboro in my opinion. You ain't a man until you take the rooster challenge. If you don't know what that is, go and find out. My wife and I eat here regularly. Food is always good... Great place in Goldsboro to have a nice dinner date not a big menu at all but one of the best steaks in town This is a pretty goodf8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047

It is hard not to gush about the quality of Chef Jeremy's cooking,... My all-time favorite Mexican restaurant! Raul gives the bet service! You won't regret going there! Orange chicken was fabulous! I can't wait to try something else. Husband had sweet and sour chicken. The sauce is made from cherries. It was delicious too. Great ribs!! This place is an institution; I always look forward to visiting Shawnee and getting real BBQ at Van's. As we were driving through Shawnee, my parents, sister, and I happened upon this place. As it was 5:30 on a Sunday afternoon, we noticed a full parking lot... Hidden gem in Shawnee! We spent this night in Shawnee during our cross-country trip and stumbled upon this place after looking at both Yelp and TripAdvisor.... Been here twice now and both were exceptional. Good food, good service...Only thing lacking was the atmosphere. ..Like most eating establishments where the... Great food! I loved everything. It was a little close corners, while eating, but I didn't mind, because the food...oh my! Generic atmosphere, service, \u0026 all, but the food was very good. Definitely a place to come back to, but not on like a date or anything...Also, good sweet BBQ... Best french fries in town, hands down! My family has been going to Hamburger King since I was a kid. Actually, since my parents were kids. No joke. This... Not only was their menu extensive but the food was delicious!  Two dollar margaritas didn't hurt either!
