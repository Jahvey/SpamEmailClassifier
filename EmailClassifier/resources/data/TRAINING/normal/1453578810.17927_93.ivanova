Re: Donald Trump credits all of his success to this, here only- http://tryitnow.vibesr.eu/checkit

Wow - what an amazing dinner. Everything was delicious!....Food: My dinner partner and I got the fried pickles, roasted chicken, macaroni and cheese,... Haven't had a bad meal here yet.  Great prime rib,  good appetizers, great craft beer selection. I'm so glad I found this place. Fast good and cheap! I was expecting better tamales out of this place.... I judge a Mexican restaurant by their tamales... The best coal fired pizza ever. We come all the way from California to eat here. The Stromboli is also impeccable! Will definitely be coming back soon! Fajitas are the best thing here. Homemade secret sauce and much more. Everything I've had here ever since I was a young kid was good. I enjoy coming here.... This place is amazing!  Great food, friendly service and a wonderful atmosphere.....I had the prime rib and I have to say it was the best prime rib I've ever... This f8f706c3938feec43d1f111ad3c0a047
