		     country. PS: if you can, avoid Venice in August. Beside being extremely crowded and expensive, canals tends to get very smelly because of the heat sometimes. Don't ruin your perfect image of the Serenissima, and visit in quieter, cheaper and cooler times.  These are excellent months if you'd like a beach holiday, as the seaside is not too crowded, but the weather is still nice and warm.  These months are also good for city tourism, since it is not too hot. Compared with August the weather is better, but the nightlife (Estate Romana etc ) is gone. However, a number of special events are organized at the beginning of September - for example the magnificent Historic Regatta along the Grand Canal in Venice. To be informed about special events organized during this period, or for that matter for any period of the year, you can obtain information from the local tourist offices of the city government. They are either called "Ente per il Turismo" or "Pro Loco". Another quick way to gather information is to rely on the internet and refer to cities' official websites. If you have already decided which event you'd like to be part of, but need more details on its location, or time frame, you should be able to find dedicated websites to pretty much every festivals or re-enactment in the country or, at least, a facebook page. These are all reliable methods to get to know up-to-date info on the places and the events you'd like to experience.  After hundreds of invitations, months of preparing, and two special words that say, ???I Do,??? getting away on your honeymoon should be a relaxing and enjoyable experience. One of the most enjoyable places to have your honeymoon is in Italy. It offers a bevy of options for a newly wedded couple to sit back, relax and enjoy their love for one another. This list will take a look at 8 romantic things to do on your honeymoon in Italy. 1. Venice It goes without saying that Venice is one of the most popular cities in the world for its beauty and natural romance. This city is famous for its gondola rides on the waterways that connect the city. While visiting Venice, you can get a ride to some of the best shopping areas in Europe; but as night falls, you can enjoy the lights of the city as you make your way through the waterways without a care in the world. After months of stressful wedding planning, there is little that is more relaxing than riding through Venice on a gondola ride with the one you love. One hot day in May, I opened the door of a tiny Sicilian caf?? and found a lone elderly woman sitting in the dark. Not realising the caf?? was closed, I told her ??? in poor Italian ??? of my quest to find a special type of chocolate that???s unique to the island. Surprised and happy to see a tourist so early in the season, she beckoned me over and pulled back a curtain. There was an entire wall of shelves holding nothing but dozens upon dozens of chocolate bars in every flavour imaginable.  For years, travellers have been drawn to Sicily???s intriguing history, smoking volcanoes and famed cuisine, but somehow the island???s distinctive chocolate ??? made in the Unesco World Heritage town of Modica and inspired by the traditions of the ancient Aztecs ??? has remained one of the world???s best-kept secrets. When the Spanish were ruling Sicily in the 16th Century, conquistadors went to Mexico and brought back cacao and the recipes needed for what the Aztecs called xoco??tl, a paste ground by a smooth round stone called a metate. Unlike the often over-sugared and creamy snack we know as chocolate, the original xoco??tl was bitter and used to enhance sauces for meat dishes, grated over salads or eaten on its own as a dietary supplement. If prepared with certain spices, it was considered an aphrodisiac. In Modica, generations of families have followed the same techniques, using metates crafted with lava stone from Mt Etna.
