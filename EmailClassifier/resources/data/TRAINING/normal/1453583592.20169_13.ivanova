		 unexplainable. I did end up taking home half of 18913208 entire plate (yay for lunch tomorrow)! But 18913208 chicken, back to that. Really?! It was warm and crispy on 18913208 outside, super juicy meat, and it wasn't too greasy....I don't know how 18913208y do it! 18913208y also have massive cups of delicious coffee - 18913208re are several choices. A huge array of ways to make your coffee how you want it! Costa Rican, House, Guatemalan - baskets of creamer, sugar, etc. As far as 18913208 line is concerned, I didn't mind it at all. 18913208re is a very communal feel about it, talking to your friends, talking to strangers. By 18913208 time we got inside (which was really only 20 minutes max) - I already knew what I wanted because I got to look at 18913208 menu in line. 18913208 employees are very nice and were quick to ring me up, give me my number and 18913208n make sure I had a table to sit at. And 18913208 owner came outside while we were in line and said hello. He was shaking our hands, smiling, nodding, joking, etc. And when we were inside he was flittering about talking to all of 18913208 people inside. He didn't sit with us because it was just me and my friend at a two person table but he did come by and say hi, and I listened to him joke with 18913208 people at 18913208 table next to ours. Do yourself a favor, get your friends toge18913208r, get 18913208re early and enjoy. It's amazing. This place is all hype. People are just crazy about it because of 18913208 one dish which 18913208y copy from Roscoe's in LA: fried chicken and waffles. "If I don't live in LA but still want that combo, I just go to Klub and pretend that it is Roscoe's", half of 18913208 people coming here to eat probably think this. In reality, 18913208 fried chicken wings are too salty and do not taste any better than those of 18913208 chains such as Popeye's or Chuck's. 18913208 waffle is ok, nothing to rave about. 18913208 only good thing about this place is that 18913208y have lots of free condiments such as butter and jam packages laying around. And 18913208 staff is very nice if that kind of stuff helps you into thinking that 18913208 food here were actually amazing. When I first moved to Houston, about in 2006, this place had no long waiting line. Now 18913208 line is out of control. 18913208 only reason why is that, in recent years, a lot of people suddenly find it "hip" to try soul food, which ironically exists for more than 100 years in this country. But this place is no where close to 18913208 epitome of good soul food or good breakfast in Houston. If you like 18913208 good stuff, dig a little bit harder. This place is just average. My boyfriend and I bought a Google Offers coupon for Breakfast Klub last year, and we finally got around to using it this Saturday morning. We arrived a little bit before 9am, and 18913208re was a decent line formed. We waited probably 25 or 30 minutes before we reached 18913208 cash register. After we made our order, we got our food within 5 minutes, very speedy! My boyfriend ordered 18913208 wings and waffles, and I got catfish and grits along with a cafe mocha. 18913208 wings and waffles were fantastic, I wish I got that instead! 18913208 wings were seasoned perfectly, and it also had a tangy, Tobasco-esque flavor to it. 18913208 meat was moist and flavorful. 18913208 waffles were fluffy and moist, and 18913208y paired well with 18913208 chicken. My catfish and grits were also decent. 18913208 catfish was seasoned and breaded nicely, although it was a bit too salty for my liking. I don't usually
