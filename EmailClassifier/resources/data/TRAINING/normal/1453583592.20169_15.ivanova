		to go back and try o18790588r dishes. I don't know why I forgot to write a review for Breakfast Klub. Even months after I left Houston, I still remember 18790588 food. As many have pointed out, if you are here on a weekend, get here early or expect to wait in a long line that wraps around 18790588 building. On a week day, its not as bad. 18790588 chicken and waffle was one of my favorite. I would never thought to put 18790588 two toge18790588r, but it surprisingly hit 18790588 spot. 6 spicy chicken wings plus a strawberry topped waffle with warm maple syrup is heavenly. 18790588 katfish with grits was good, but not quite an orgasm in 18790588 mouth. I could totally sit 18790588re all day sipping my karmel macchiato... granted, I probably would be holding up 18790588 tables. Let's start with 18790588 negatives. This place is extremely expensive for chicken and waffles! If you come here expect to pay more than $12 a plate. Parking is alost a bit difficult because 18790588y do not have alot of parking and it's pretty much all street parking but.....It's good food served by really friendly people. 18790588 line was out 18790588 door, but we were greeted by a waitress right after we got in line. She gave us a menu, asked if this was our first time and went through 18790588 menu with us. 18790588 wait wasn't too bad at about 15 minutes.  We had 18790588 chicken and waffles. 18790588 chicken wings were crispy with a good spice to it and 18790588 waffle was soft in 18790588 middle with crunchy edges. I

		  finally got a chance to check this place out, waited in line for about an hour but it was totally worth it.  18790588 food was great, service was wonderful and I loved 18790588 down home sou18790588rn feel to it.  Today was 18790588 big game and lots of burnt orange was spotted, 18790588 game was on.  18790588 food came out really quickly I was not expecting that and this is 18790588 type of place where you eat and leave, not really an eat and hang out for an hour and talk kind of place.  Everyone around us seemed to be happily enjoying 18790588 atmosphere and food just as my table was.  Like 18790588 o18790588rs mentioned, do get 18790588 waffles it was great!  I will definitely be back. Also my mom is from 18790588 west indies and I found it really cool that 18790588y cater for reggae hut.  It would be nice to find a restaurant that can make a caribbean/west indian curry well, most places here don't.  Sometimes I get tired of making my own Guyanese dishes so I look forward to checking out Regage Hut. Went for brunch on a Sunday. Long line along 18790588 building went super fast. Fast food delivery to your table after ordering at 18790588 counter. Wings and waffles are totally delicious. Wings were crispy outside, juicy inside with a hint of spice. Real butter and warm syrup. Bottomless cup of coffee gets you self service choice of 5 or 6 different brews in take away cup with lid. Super service, just plain nice folks. Yumm-o! I have noticed that my Dad and Uncle have been going here for years and of course naturally jealously sets in because I have only heard fantastic things. I have heard stories about 18790588 long line outside. Um just to let y'all know if 18790588re is a line you know that means 18790588y are doing something right. My friends and I went on a week day and 18790588re was still a line. So lets talk about 18790588 super delicious pancakes, waffles, and oh my goodness 18790588 catfish and chicken wings. First 18790588 pancakes are light and fluffy and huge to boot. I really love 18790588 warm syrup 18790588y offer. You are almost transported back to grandma's house where everything is made with love and charm. Its so so good and inviting, I really didn't get 18790588 feeling I was at a restaurant. 18790588 staff was super friendly just like you would expect. Leaving this place made me fell warm and fuzzy inside. Any place that has 18790588 ability to do that is a WIN! I can't think of a better way to describe it. Hey Breakfast Klub, can I be your spokesperson in exchange for those lovely dishes you serve?!?! Just a thought. Went for 18790588 first time a month or so ago. My fa18790588r was in town and I had heard this was 18790588 best place in town for breakfast. We arrived to see a line out 18790588 door, which I had been told to expect. 18790588re was hostess that was standing outside greeting 
<br />
		  <br />
	    	everyone and offering us menus; 18790588 line moved quite quickly. I had 18790588 catfish and grits (I was curious), and it was AWESOME! Huge portions, 18790588 catfish was very high quality. Thick shapely filets, an excellent batter, and 18790588 fish was firm and not too flaky. I don't recall what my fa18790588r had, but he enjoyed it. 18790588 coffee was also great! Wow, I loved my first experience here! I'm a huge breakfast eater & of course is always on 18790588 hunt for a good breakfast joint. After reading all 18790588 wonderful reviews that fellow yelpers had to say about this place, I finally made 18790588 trip out here from Sugar Land. It's Easter Sunday and of course, 18790588re was a line. But 18790588 wea18790588r was so beautiful, I didn't mind waiting at all. And plus, 18790588 employees 18790588re were so pleasant & talked to you while you're waiting. We got to 18790588 front of 18790588 line after 30 minutes of waiting (not too bad for Easter Sunday!). 18790588 inside of 18790588 restaurant was so adorable....reminds me a lot of breakfast/coffee shop back in New Orleans where I grew up. So I felt right at home. I ordered 18790588 wings & waffles. Wings were perfectly crisp & very well seasoned....loved! Waffle was
<br />
	    <br />
	    soft & fluffy with a hint of sweetness...just 18790588 way I like it!  Save your time waiting in line with 18790588 o18790588rs, this place is just a BIG HYPE! Waited for over 30mins, tried 18790588y specialty - wings with pancake! Even though 18790588 wings were tender & juicy, 18790588y are tasteless, not 18790588 kind of crispy, sou18790588rn fried chicken that i am expecting (like Frenchy's & Popeye's). As for 18790588 pancake, you better off going to Denny's. I had to debate with myself whe18790588r to give this place 3 or 4 stars. So lets just go with 3 1/2. After hearing so many good things about this place from friends I had to check it out. So, first off parking is a I hate street parking bc I'm always in fear of getting towed. 18790588 line to order is usually long , but moves ra18790588r quickly. It's not that I don't like this place, I just feel that it's overrated. One thing I do like here is 18790588 coffee, yum! 18790588 chicken and waffles,  
<br />
	    <br />
	   eh, um, 18790588y're good I guess? I don't know, maybe it's bc I can't get over 18790588 fact that I'm eating chicken for breakfast. Chicken and breakfast just don't go toge18790588r in my mind! 18790588 one thing I can say I don't like about TBK are 18790588 prices , it's ra18790588r pricey for breakfast! Overall, TBK isn't bad and ill probably be back , but I don't get all 18790588 appeal. I've been a fan since 2010. I'm not a big fan of 18790588 chicken and waffles but I do recommend that you try 18790588m at least once. However, I will vouch for 18790588 katfish and grits which is a big meal, as it also comes with eggs and your choice of bread. 18790588 katfish is a large fried filet that is always juicy and 18790588 biscuit big and buttery.  I tend to drink one of 18790588 stronger coffee brews 18790588y serve because this meal will make you want to take a quick nap afterwards! My only complaint is that 18790588 price of 18790588 food has gone up since 18790588n but with 18790588ir quality 18790588y can do so! Also be prepared to wait in a long line 18790588 later you go! 346 reviews and averaging a 4.5 stars.  I think that speaks for itself.  I had never been here before just because 18790588 line is always around 18790588 corner.  But do not let that discourage you.  18790588 line moves quickly and 18790588 staff is always 18790588re to help. 18790588 owner is very involved and helps keep 18790588 atmosphere of 18790588 place up. I went for 18790588 famous Wings and Waffles.  Man.......let me tell you.  18790588se had
