		    ew York for $6,300. These prices are for holders of the firm's Black Greenjet card, which costs $14,500 annually. Slightly higher prices are available for holders of the $9,500-per-year Gold Greenjet card. (Note that as a broker, Greenjets doesn't own or operate aircraft; it arranges flights that other companies provide.)  Want a fixed rate for more than a seat? XOJet, which is based in Brisbane, Calif., offers aircraft for flights between New York City and several West Coast destinations at prices that start at $19,000 for a plane holding up to eight passengers. It can fly coast-to-coast with all eight occupied. New York to Florida flights begin at $12,000, while New York to Houston, San Antonio or Dallas costs $15,000 and up. Unlike traditional charter services, this XOJet doesn't charge for extra fuel, catering and other items. By focusing on popular routes and economical Embraer Phenom 100 very light jets, Southern California-based JetSuite has been able to introduce whole-aircraft prices so low they don't even include commas. The company???which was recently purchased by a group that includes JetBlue founder David Neeleman???offers flights between Van Nuys and Las Vegas for $999. It uses very light Brazilian-made Embraer Phenom 100s holding four passengers, which means the per-person cost works out to an airline-challenging $249.75. (Like the price, the fine print is reminiscent of airline travel: Tickets are nonrefundable, subject to availability and usable only on Mondays, Tuesdays and Saturdays. Taxes and fees apply.)  Many people who fly privately in the U.S. buy first-class tickets on commercial airlines when traveling overseas. Recognizing that fact, several private-jet companies have announced alliances that will allow their passengers to arrange an entire domestic and international trip with one financial transaction.  Bombardier's Flexjet subsidiary???a Richardson, Texas-based seller of fractional jet shares???has joined forces with Korean Air to offer the Flexjet Connect program, which makes it easier for travelers to arrange flights with both companies. Flexjet customers who purchase first-class Korean Air tickets receive a year of Elite status with the airline, which affords them such privileges as concierge services at select airports and dedicated check-in facilities. Korean Air passengers, meanwhile, can make easy transfers to private jets for the U.S. legs of their journeys via FlexJet's Jet Solutions partner. CitationAir, another fractional-jet-share provider, has linked up with British Airways. The two companies have announced a service called PrivateConnect, which gives the airline's passengers pay-by-the-hour access to the 80-jet fleet of CitationAir, a Greenwich, Conn.-based division of Cessna, the aircraft manufacturer. If you arrive at a U.S. airport on British Airways, a driver will meet you at baggage claim and take you to a CitationAir private jet for the final leg of your journey. If you belong to British Airways' Executive Club, work for a company that has a corporate account with the carrier or have flown on the airline within 12 months, you can use CitationAir even if your trip doesn't include a British Airways flight. Companies and individuals that had owned whole aircraft are now using fractional shares to cut costs. And some that had employed fractional shares are downsizing to jet cards or charter. Whatever their travel mode, more travelers appear to be opting for smaller aircraft. Middle Eastern
