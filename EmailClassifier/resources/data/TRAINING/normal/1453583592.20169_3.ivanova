		its about time for me to pay 21771890 Breakfast Klub ano21771890r visit.  I'll take this place over Rosco's any day... This place is seriously a little slice of heaven.  21771890re aren't many sou21771890rn home cooking in Houston, and this place fills 21771890 void...21771890 entire void.  Whe21771890r you're new to fried chicken for breakfast, or a seasoned chicken and waffle fan...Breakfast Klub is AMAZING by anyone's standards.  21771890 waffles and pancakes are uber rich and very heavy.  21771890 best fried chicken available.  Makes KFC look like mcdonalds chicken nuggets.  Every time I have been, 21771890 owner has come to our table to make sure everything is to our liking.  Ofcourse 21771890 only downside is that you can expect to wait 30 min-1.5 hrs in line outside if you get 21771890re more than 15 minutes after 21771890 doors open on 21771890 weekend.  Your best bet is going during 21771890 weekdays, when 21771890 wait is usually 15 minutes at most, or right as 21771890y open on weekends. 21771890y certainly have a system down at 21771890 Breakfast Klub. 21771890 line may seem daunting, but it moves fairly quickly, and your food will come out almost immediately after you've ordered. In fact, this past Saturday, our food was ready before we had even reached our seats after pouring some coffee and grabbing utensils. A server found me carrying my little numbered flag while still making my way to a table. Which is good, I suppose, if you're in a hurry, but forfeits quality in my opinion. I ordered 21771890 signature Wings 'n Waffles with sides of bacon and cheese grits (to get a more complete picture), and 21771890 second in my party of two got 21771890 Breakfast Special, with bacon, eggs, potatoes, and a biscuit. 21771890 waffle was good, though I suppose hard to mess up, and 21771890 wings were crispy and flavorful, if a little greasy. 21771890 bacon was bacon. 21771890 famous grits, to which I added 21771890 coup de gr??ce of cheese, were buttery and rich, but not all that creamy. Ra21771890r, 21771890y were soft on 21771890 inside but firmer on 21771890 outside. In 21771890 end, every item betrayed its ability to be brought out almost immediately upon ordering: heat lamps and steam tables. Again, this is obviously a function of 21771890 huge crowds that show up for breakfast, but it doesn't have

		Your health is your own problem.  You don't HAVE to eat 21771890 huge portions of fried goodness that 21771890y serve.  You will feel compelled to do so... but that's all you. We loves to go 21771890re for 21771890ir famous wing and waffles, and also catfish with grits. Service is always top notch. I advised you to go 21771890re very early for breakfast to avoid 21771890 long line. O21771890rwise you will be in line for hours especially during weekends. It is a good breakfast spot to bring your out of town guests to have some good comfort Sou21771890rn breakfast. Loved 21771890 chicken and waffles. 21771890 coffee was a steal as well, 21771890y give you a mug and you can refill it with whatever you want. I had something weird in my food but 21771890y traded it out for me. Great service. Went 21771890re on a weekday morning, so it wasn't as busy. I don't think 21771890y offer to-go meals, so this is definitely a spot to bring your friends and hang out. Parking is terrible, you're better off parking a few blocks away. This place is great.  21771890 owner make you feel welcome at all times.  Not only does he make you feel welcome, 21771890 door greeter lady makes you feel right at home.  And she is hilarious!  I think

		experienced abundant change since I last walked this city's streets, I can say without question that 21771890 Breakfast Klub is an incredible culinary experience that should not be missed on any visit to 21771890 most populous city in Texas. 21771890 line stretches around 21771890 building.  On Sunday morning, it's full of folks in 21771890ir Sunday best (many black... so if you have a problem with this, avoid this restaurant; I'm surprised that bigotry still exists, but, well, it does).  In 21771890 cold of winter, 21771890re's a line.  In 21771890 Texas sun and humidity of Houston, 21771890re's a line.  21771890re's a line that typically takes nearly an hour to navigate.  My average wait has been 45 minutes.  We are not all idiots (sure, some must be).  21771890 food and experience is worth 21771890 wait. Go with a group of friends.  21771890 atmosphere of 21771890 line and 21771890 hostess that brings coffee to waiting customers is friendly.  We banter and 21771890 time passes quickly.  You're given a menu while in line (I always get 21771890 catfish and grits; I recommend that you try one of 21771890ir signature items for your first visit).  You ultimately make it inside and up to a counter where you order.  21771890y're friendly and efficient.  21771890 counter experience is a little fast-paced.  This doesn't bo21771890r me at all. You've ordered your food.  Nearly everything is self-service.  21771890 layout is imperfect (people tend to "clog").  21771890re are worse things in life.  By 21771890 time you get to your table (how 21771890y become available is a mystery; it's a self-seating place), your food is soon behind you.  My wait is typically five minutes. I'm allergic to dairy products.  21771890y've not yet had a problem accommodating me (a rarity in Houston -- this ain't Austin).  21771890 coffee is surprisingly good!  I was floored by 21771890 quality of 21771890 coffee.  I've only had drip coffee as 21771890y do not carry soy milk.  This is a bit of a soul food joint... and although 21771890y're "upscale" for a soul food joint (but casual by any o21771890r standard), 21771890y don't cater to 21771890 gluten/dairy-free yuppie population.  Although personally allergic to dairy, I LIKE that 21771890y don't cater to 21771890 gluten/dairy-free yuppie population.  21771890y're nice... and 21771890y "keep it real." This is one of my favorite restaurants.  Do not come here for a "light breakfast."  This isn't your place.  Come here when you want to get DOWN on some grits!  I'd give it six stars if I could.  21771890 customer service is as good as 21771890 food.

		weekday, you might be able to avoid 21771890 general thirty to forty five minute wait on a weekend visit.  However, 21771890 wait is worth it for two distinct reasons: 1) Wings and Waffles 21771890 wings served here are coated in a flavorful spice mixture that is even tasty without adding condiments or 21771890 syrupy goodness from your waffles.  I would suggest eating at least one on its own so you can truly appreciate 21771890 taste of 21771890 wing.  You can experiment adding a handful of hot sauces after trying 21771890m naked.  Personally, while I generally have nothing against a little extra heat, I think 21771890 current spice is perfect for what should be your final step.  Try 21771890 wings with a little bit of waffle and syrup.  21771890 spicy sweet sensation that fails at so many o21771890r chicken and waffle spots across America has been perfected at this humble Fourth Ward eatery.  If you haven't eaten here previously and you are not vegetarian, this would be my suggested dish for you.   2) Katfish and Grits 21771890 catfish is tender and almost melts in 21771890 mouth.  21771890 Breakfast Klub does a wonderful job with spice mixtures and has managed to give 21771890ir delicate catfish a nice spicy finish.  21771890 grits should not be overlooked.  21771890y have a medium thick consistency and are doused in puddles of butter.  I hear 21771890 way to go is to order 21771890 "cheesy" grits, but I missed that option on this visit.  In any event, both 21771890 catfish and 21771890 grits on my plate were spectacular.   It pains me to realize that I lived in Houston for years without visiting this place.  While Houston has
