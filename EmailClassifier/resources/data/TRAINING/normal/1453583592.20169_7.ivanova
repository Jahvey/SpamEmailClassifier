		     shipping from factories while older technologies are still being assessed and rated. So it???s always best to do a little research first and, if possible, consult a lighting designer or knowledgeable employee at your hardware store. Replacing Your Old Bulbs With LEDs Many folks don???t need specialized strip lighting but need to replace standard screw-base bulbs in ordinary table lamps. Jantz-Sell says that Energy Star verifies that the LED replacement bulb matches the performance of the bulb it is meant to replace. ???So an Energy Star-certified LED bulb labeled A19 (the A-bulb equivalent) must be omnidirectional like the bulb it is supposed to replace,??? she says. ???A labeled PAR38, common for outdoor security lights, must direct light the same way with the same beam intensity as a halogen PAR38. The same goes for an MR16, a common small-diameter spotlight.??? LEDs are flexible in that they can be used in specific, focused areas as well as for multidirectional ambient lighting. As more people talk and learn about LED light bulbs, you may be wondering if it's worth your while to invest in LEDs for your home or office. The answer depends on your willingness to look at long-term financial results and whether you're trying to "time the market." Unlike early generations of LED lighting, today's LED lights are plenty bright for replacing traditional incandescent bulbs (the usual A19 shape that many of us imagine when we think of a light bulb). And LEDs now do a very good job of matching the warm yellow that many people want in a home or some office settings. The new designs seen on the market also look similar to the bulbs we're used to, eliminating one of the past reasons to hesitate in making the switch. With the use of compatible dimmer switches, they even dim very well. Yet LED bulbs also offer colors that move away from a warm, yellow toward what we think of as cooler whites ??? "daylight" style bulbs. Packaging will show this color shift in "Kelvin" -- about 2700K is what most people are accustomed to in their homes. A bulb in the 3000s will be distinctly whiter than what most people expect in that setting; 4100K is typical of many office settings; and 5000K is used where color rendering is very important -- jewelry stores or medical exam areas, for instance. Because of this flexibility, LEDs can replace more than just your average A19 bulb. You can also find decorative LED bulbs (e.g., candle style bulbs for chandeliers or decorative fixtures, and globe bulbs for bathroom vanities); LED downlights for recessed lighting; LED exit signs; and LED outdoor fixtures. In fact, entire cities are now saving money by replacing their old street lights with LED street lights. So at this point, unless you're particular about the look of a light bulb or the precise kind of light you get from it, LED bulbs are fantastic replacement lights, and are likely the premier bulb for the next several years, especially as prices continue to fall and they continue to produce more light per watt. This last point begs the question: when should you invest in LED bulbs? If they're going to keep falling in price, and they're going to keep producing more light per watt as new LED generations are produced, why invest right now? But this is the same question you might ask when looking at computers. The next generation of computers will always be a little better, and prices on technology always move down. Does that mean you should wait for the last and best computer ever made? No ... because that computer won't be made in your lifetime, and you don't want to keep working on a typewriter in the meantime. This is pretty much what you're doing if you stick with incandescent bulbs for as long as possible simply to wait for some
