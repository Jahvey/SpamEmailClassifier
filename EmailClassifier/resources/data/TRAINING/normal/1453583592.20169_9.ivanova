		  Rental Policy covers the rental period and is designed specifically to meet the needs of this new and growing market. 
According to BoatUS Assistant Vice President Ed Holownia, most recreational boat insurance policies don???t provide coverage during a rental. ???For boats to become a viable part of the sharing economy, the insurance question had to be addressed,??? he said. Now three years old and with thousands of boats listed across the US, Boatbound has been the fastest-growing company in the boat sharing market, according to BoatUS Boatbound???s average renter is between 25 and 44 years old with five or more years of boating experience. ???Boatbound is fundamentally changing boating,??? said Boatbound Founder Aaron Hall. ???Finding a boat is now as easy as finding a hotel, and boat owners can share their boat when it???s not in use to offset boat, slip, and maintenance costs turning their boats into assets??? ith the new Peer-to-Peer Boat Rental Policy, BoatUS offers coverage to renters and protection to owners for rentals arranged through Boatbound. Boat owners wishing to rent their boat through Boatbound must have an underlying recreational boat insurance policy. Those with BoatUS or Seaworthy Insurance Co. policies will be eligible for a fast-track approval process. Once the boat owner signs up at Boatbound.co and gets approved, the Peer-to-Peer Boat Rental Policy provides primary coverage during each rental period. The cost of the policy is included in the fee owners pay Boatbound for each rental. The Peer-to-Peer Boat Rental Policy is underwritten by Seaworthy Insurance Co. and will pay up to the actual cash value of the boat. The policy includes $300,000 liability coverage per person and up to $1 million total liability coverage per accident. Up to $854,400 in fuel spill coverage is also included as are $25,000 per person/per accident medical payments coverage, $100,000 in uninsured boater coverage, and full salvage coverage up to the boat???s actual cash value. Deductibles are based on boat value. She cleared the west end of the Dardanelles at 0730 on the evening of February 16th, 2012. The weather in northwestern Turkey at the time was cold, wintry. Canakkale, a seaport only a few nautical miles inside the strait, reported evening temperatures of 40 degrees F or thereabouts, with light winds coming out of the north. There were no charter guests onboard. Only crewmembers. Eight of them. All French nationals. Captain Jean Louis Carrel contemplated the journey ahead???the vessel beneath his feet, Yogi, a 197-foot Proteksan Turquoise-built beauty less than one year old, with the serene style of a Balinese dancer, the accommodations of a world-class resort, and the technological sophistication of a luxury airliner, was headed south first, down the fabled wine-dark waters of the Aegean, then west around the headlands of Greece and Italy, and finally on up to Cannes, in the south of France. The weather worsened as the hours passed. At 1000, the Turkish meteorological service at Bozcaada, a small island at the very mouth of the Dardenelles, observed Force 7 conditions, a near gale, with wind speeds approaching 30-some knots and seas building to heights of 16 feet or more. When midnight came, Yogi continued south despite the storm???s ferocity. What happened thereafter???during the rest of that grim night???remains a great mystery today, perhaps one of the greatest mysteries to trouble the international yachting milieu in decades. According to reports appearing in both the mainstream media and the yachting press over the following weeks, an
