Dear Sir,

IMPORTANT INFORMATION

I am contacting with regards to this particular fund belonging to my deceased client, I decided to contact you about this unclaimed deposits. If you are not interested, please ignore this mail and go about your normal business. I am Barrister Johnson Douglas, principal partner of  Douglas Chambers & Co, Law Office and Notaries Public and practising Law in United Kingdom. I specialise in family law, will, probate and tax saving strategies. On May 12 2010, one of my senior clients’ Mr. Thomas  Bahia   a DUTCH died in a plane crash that happened in Libya. Here is a link for your view: http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/13/world/middleeast/13libya.html?_r=1     message received on 02/12 at 08:17.

My client stated his wife as his next of kin, but unfortunately she died also in the crash, along with their three children. I am the executor of my client’s will and have shared his assets and properties to his extended family members and they have gone since December 2010.

But my client deposited the sum of $5.8 million United States Dollars in a fixed deposit account in a bank in United Kingdom not known to anybody. On January 15th 2015 the bank wrote me as his lawyer/executor to bring along the next of kin/beneficiary of  my client  to inherit  his funds (US$5.8m). I have therefore decided to contact you to present you as the next of kin/beneficiary to my client, to enable you receive the fund on our behalf as my client’s  spouse and dependent all died in the plane crash with him. All the documents required to claim this funds are in my possession like the affidavit of claim, death certificate, certificate of deposit, transfer of ownership, certificate of inheritance etc. 

I will forward to you all these documents required to claim this funds. All I need from you is to indicate your interest to be the next of kin/beneficiary to my dead client and I will present it to the bank. This is 100% legitimate. When you receive the money in your account I will come over to your country for the sharing as follows> 45% for you and 45% for me. The remaining 10% will be set aside for expenses that will be incurred by both parties during the course of this transfer to your account. As the fiduciary/trusted representative of the deceased, and as the manager of his assets, properties and financial affairs when Mr. Thomas Bahia was alive, I have absolute duty to properly administer the estate for its beneficiary.This is my private email address:johnsondouglas4238@gmail.com or call at +447596489376

Thanks,


Johnson Douglas.
